<p>
  Forms are made formBuilder forms by initializing them as formBuilder widgets. FormBuilder 
  will search for form fields and construct them automatically. 
  
</p>
<div class="example">
  <form class="fb">
    <input type="text" data-type="utext" data-label="Name"/>
    <input type="text" data-type="email" data-label="Email"/>
  </form>
</div>
<div data-mode="html" data-title="HTML (before initization)" class="code"></div>
<p>To keep the form hidden until it is constructed or if it is unsupported, style the form with</p>
<div data-mode="html" class="code">
  <form>
  	....
  </form>
</div>
<p>Only elements inside of the formBuilder are effected</p>
