<h1><a name="about" class="anchor"></a>About</h1><p>The formBuilder library is designed to allow a user to easily build an online form in any way that they wish. We have developed many unique input types that are designed to meet many different specific needs that you may have for your forms, such as allowing the user to enter date ranges, phone numbers, emails, and much more. Each input type has been created in such a way that they will filter out incorrect inputs depnding on the input field type and are able to ensure that forms are filled out correctly. There are also many optional modifications and additions that are possible for each input type in order to meet individual needs. </p>
