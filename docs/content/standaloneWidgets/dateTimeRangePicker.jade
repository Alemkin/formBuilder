	p The Date-Time-Range Picker creates two input fields for a beginning and ending date and also inclues time fields for each date. Different ranges can be selected using the drop down panel. Arrow buttons can be used to move date ranges forwards or backwards by the allotted amount of time. This widget uses the date data-type and the time-data type and follows their rules for validation. If no time is selected, then the time fields will default to 12:00am and 11:59pm.
