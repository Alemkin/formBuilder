* **What is formBuilder?**

    FormBuilder is a library that can be used to create forms that are able to accept user input and save the data in varying ways depending on what data-types the input fields are. There are many different input field data-types and each have different filters, validation methods, and options that dictate what kind of data they can or can not accept, and how the input fields will look and behave. These types have been developed to meet the typical needs of what would be desired from an online form, such as a phone number type, an email type, a regular text input type, and many more. It is also possible, if these types do not meet the requirements of what is needed for a form that is being built, to easily design a custom type by modifying a set of base methods that have been outlined in the API. 

    If you would like to see an example of how a simple form can be made and used, feel free to look ahead to our <a href="./guide.html#demo">Live Demo</a>.

* **How can formBuilder be used?**

    FormBuilder can be used by creating base forms using the formBuilder library, and then building upon those forms by adding as many different kinds of input as are desired. In order to use this library you must be able to program in javascript and understand how to build webpages using html. 

    For a more in-depth understanding of how to use and manipulate each different available resource in the formBuilder library, please feel free to look ahead to our <a href='./api.html#widgets'>API Reference</a>

* **Why should I use formBuilder to make my forms?**

    FormBuilder allows you to create complicated input fields on forms by using only one or two lines of code in your html file. By implementing one or two attributes on an input field you will be able to apply large changes to how the field will appear and how it will handle data. It is a quick and easy way to be able to eliminate most human error from any online form that you are trying to build. By using input types that have been designed to only accept certain entries you can help to prevent the chance that forms will be submitted to you incorrectly. FormBuilder is also very easy to understand and implement into your code and the user guide and API reference that have been provided to you are useful tools to be able to understand and see examples of how to build your form using formBuilder. In short formBuilder is a useful tool that can be used to enhance any web form that you are trying to build.
