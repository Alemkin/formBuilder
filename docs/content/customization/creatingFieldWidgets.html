  Using custom field widgets with formBuilder allows you to make new input methods beyond simple 
  input fields. Like input types, they require a set of functions to work with formBuilder (see 
  <a href="./api.html#widgets-fieldWidget">fieldWidget</a>). Any widget that handles data can be 
  made a field widget with these functions. Widgets with nested formBuilder forms can be used to 
  make form section templates as well.

  To load an element as a field widget add the <code>data-load-widget-as-field="widgetName"</code> 
  attribute. The element must be inside of a form element. When the form element is initialized 
  as a formBuilder widget, it will automatically initialize the widget with "widgetName" on the 
  element. This element <i>must</i> have a name attribute.

  Here is an example of a HTML5 canvas color picker as a custom field widget. Both the custom 
  type <code>colorHex</code> and widget <code>customColorPicker</code> were made for this 
  example. As a type, the colorHex could be used outside of this picker. The picker uses the 
  inputField to handle the typed input, while also drawing color slices around it for a quick 
  selection. This widget can be reused easily with formBuilder, with options avaliable for 
  instance specific needs. <i>If you cannot see the color picker, upgrade your browser.</i>
